# pandas-challenge
In this challenge, I'll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

## Background
In this endeavor, I have embraced the responsibility of assisting the city's school district board and mayor in making informed decisions about future school budgets and priorities. For my initial assignment, I have been entrusted with the task of analyzing the standardized test results across the entire district. I have access to individual students' math and reading scores, as well as comprehensive information about the schools they attend. My primary goal is to effectively aggregate the data and present discernible patterns that highlight the performance of schools within the district..

## Instructions
I will leverage the power of Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to generate a comprehensive report encompassing the provided dataset. The report will present essential data insights and will also include a written analysis highlighting at least two notable trends observed from the data.

### District Summary
I will use Pandas and Jupyter Notebook to perform the necessary calculations. Afterward, I will create a DataFrame that provides a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics.
 Include the following:
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### School Summary
I"ll perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.
 Include the following:
- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by **% Overall Passing** in descending order and display the top 5 rows then save the results in a DataFrame called **"top_schools"**.

### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
Sort the schools by **% Overall Passing** in ascending order and display the top 5 rows then save the results in a DataFrame called **"bottom_schools"**.

### Math Scores by Grade
I will perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade
I"ll create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending
Corrected version: I will create a table that analyzes school performance based on average spending ranges per student. To achieve this, I will categorize the spending data into four bins with reasonable cutoff values using **'pd.cut'**. This categorization will allow me to group schools based on their spending levels and examine their performance accordingly. Next, I will calculate the mean scores for each spending range. Finally, I will create a DataFrame called **"spending_summary"** to summarize the results.
Include the following metrics in the table:
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Scores by School Size
I will use the following code to bin the "Total Students" column of the **per_school_summary** DataFrame. I will apply **pd.cut** to categorize the data based on school size into small, medium, or large categories.
Then, I will create a DataFrame called **"size_summary"** that breaks down school performance based on school size.

### Scores by School Type
I will use the per_school_summary DataFrame from the previous step to create a new DataFrame called **"type_summary"**. This DataFrame will showcase school performance based on the "School Type" category.

### Written Report
The written report presents a cohesive written analysis that:
- Summarizes the analysis 
- Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations
